## Abstract
When building an intrusion detection system, the way data is represented ultimately determines how we define anomalous activity. We assert that to characterize the normalcy of a process, the data representation must capture what portions of the system it edited, the times that these edits occurred, and a characterization of its parent. To this end, we propose an architecture that uses an attention mechanism to embed information about which system entities were edited, and feeds it to a conditional GAN. The GAN’s generator learns the distribution of process embeddings, given the executable’s filename. Its discriminator learns to detect unusual processes embeddings by comparing real embeddings to generated ones. The detector also makes use of a message passing neural network; this ensures embeddings are propagated through the process tree so even benign looking child processes are marked as anomalous if their parent is. Importantly, this process is entirely inductive; the model trained on one host may be applied to other hosts in the same network to classify processes it has never seen. To evaluate this system we test it on log files of a real-world system undergoing a malware campaign. The results of these tests show that this system can out-perform other unsupervised anomalous process detection algorithms on this data set and is a viable method for forensic analysis of compromised systems.
